3.1,Main Characteristics data,Data description,"Crop statistics are recorded for 173 products, covering the following categories: Crops Primary, Fibre Crops Primary, Cereals, Coarse Grain, Citrus Fruit, Fruit, Jute Jute-like Fibres, Oilcakes Equivalent, Oil crops Primary, Pulses, Roots and Tubers, Treenuts and Vegetables and Melons. Data are expressed in terms of area harvested, production quantity and yield. The objective is to comprehensively cover production of all primary crops for all countries and regions in the world.Cereals: Area and production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed or silage or used for grazing are therefore excluded. Area data relate to harvested area. Some countries report sown or cultivated area only"
3.2,Main Characteristics data,Classification system,"CPC 2.1 Expanded and FAO Commodity List (FCL), which are an internal FAO classification systems."
3.2.1,Main Characteristics data,Primary classification,
3.2.2,Main Characteristics data,Secondary classification,
3.2.3,Main Characteristics data,Secondary classification,
3.3,Main Characteristics data,Sector coverage,Most crop products under agricultural activity.
3.4,Main Characteristics data,Statistical concepts and definitions,"Areas refer to the area under cultivation. Area under cultivation means the area that corresponds to the total sown area, but after the harvest it excludes ruined areas (e.g. due to natural disasters). If the same land parcel is used twice in the same year, the area of this parcel can be counted twice. For tree crops, some countries provide data in terms of number of trees instead of in area. This number is then converted to an area estimate using typical planting density conversions. Production means the harvested production. Harvested production means production including on-holding losses and wastage, quantities consumed directly on the farm and marketed quantities, indicated in units of basic product weight. Harvest year means the calendar year in which the harvest begins. Yield means the harvested production per ha for the area under cultivation. Seed quantity comprises all amounts of the commodity in question used during the reference period for reproductive purposes, such as seed or seedlings. Whenever official data are not available, seed figures can be estimated either as a percentage of production or by multiplying a seed rate (the average amount of seed needed per hectare planted) with the planted area of the particular crop of the subsequent year. Usually, the average seed rate in any given country does not vary greatly from year to year."
3.5,Main Characteristics data,Statistical unit,Agriculture holdings cultivated for the production of crops.

4.1,Units,Unit of measure codes,
5.0,Reference period,Reference period,"The reference period is the harvest year. The year indicates that the data refer to production harvested during the calendar year. Certain products, root crops (like fodder kale) or fruit (olives and citrus fruits) may be harvested over two consecutive calendar years (n and n+1) from the same planted area, in which case the harvests would be recorded by agreement under the preceding year (n)."
6.0,Formal Set of Instructions,Institutional mandate,"Article I of the FAO Constitution requires that the Organization collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture (the term agriculture and its derivatives includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture). The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the rationale: If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time."

11.1,Availability of National Reference,Documentation on methodology,"National reference metadata are submitted by some countries, but these are not yet disseminated by FAO. No methodological papers, except the classification scheme, have been produced to date."
11.2,Availability of National Reference,Quality documentation,"No quality reports or studies are carried out by FAO to assess the quality of national-level data, and no national quality reports are collected at present."
12.0,Management System FAO,Quality management,
12.1,Management System FAO,Quality assurance,"Statistics are subject to the general quality assurance framework of FAO, where domain-specific quality assurance activities (the use of best practices, quality reviews, self-assessments, compliance monitoring) are carried out systematically. For more information, consult the FAO Statistics Quality Assurance Framework, available here: http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3664e/i3664e.pdf."
12.2,Management System FAO,Quality assessment,"The quality of data varies considerably between countries depending upon their individual data collection methodologies. FAO recommends that sample surveys should be representative of at least 95% of the total area and land under a given crop. Surveys on production or yields should be conducted using statistically recognized methods as regards quality, objectivity and reliability. More information on metadata and certain validation procedures at country level is certainly needed."
13.1,Classification Users,User needs,"The main users are FAO analysts, other international organizations, ministries and government agencies, agro-industry, trade and professional associations, research institutes and universities, journalists and the general public. The objectives of these users vary, but agricultural production statistics are especially useful for market management/monitoring, production forecasts and policy-making in agriculture and food. FAO is not aware of unmet needs. Users are encouraged to contact the dataset owner for resolving more specific queries that are not addressed elsewhere in these metadata."
13.2,Classification Users,User satisfaction,The FAOSTAT User Consultation took place during April-December 2018. http://www.fao.org/3/ca7239en/ca7239en.pdf
13.3,Classification Users,Completeness,"The coverage of official production data provided by countries varies substantially by reporter, with some countries providing little to no data, while others provide data only for major commodities. As a result, official data for certain product categories or regions may be incomplete. For this reason, a substantial amount of data points are imputed in order to provide a complete global production dataset. More details on imputation rates and frequencies can be found in Section 20 of these metadata."
14.1,Main Sources of Error,Overall accuracy,"It is not possible to assess the overall accuracy of the dataset, as the source data is largely collected by member countries. For data that is imputed (including for non-reporting countries or for products for which countries do not collect official data), the accuracy of the imputations is unknown. However, imputation processes are assessed and adjusted on a regular basis."
14.2,Main Sources of Error,Sampling error,"No information is available regarding sampling error. In the EU, regulations mandate that the coefficient of variation shall not exceed 3% for the area of cultivation for main crops. For non-EU countries, the coefficient of variation may be significantly larger. For further information, see country metadata (if available)."
14.3,Main Sources of Error,Non-sampling error,"No information is available regarding the magnitude of non-sampling errors. Non-sampling errors may occur as a result of measurement errors, caused by a lack of harmonization in statistical methods. For instance, significant measurement errors may be present in instances where FAO concepts do not fit with national concepts."
15.1,Timeliness and punctuality,Timeliness,"Data are uploaded for dissemination twice a year, irrespectively when they arrive at FAO."
15.2,Timeliness and punctuality,Punctuality,FAO strives to publish data on the most recent production year within 6 months of receiving the annual production questionnaires.
16.1,Comparability Between Countries or Regions,Comparability - geographical,"There is limited geographical comparability due to differences between countries in methods and coverage, except for regions where countries are bound by regulations mandating harmonized methods, such as EU countries."
16.1.1,Comparability Between Countries or Regions,Code - geographical comparability,
16.2,Comparability Between Countries or Regions,Comparability - over time,"For shorter time periods, reasonably good comparability over time can be expected, as there is stability in the product definition and classification. However, as the time series are very long (from 1961) full comparability over time cannot be expected."
16.2.1,Comparability Between Countries or Regions,Code - time Comparability,
17.1,Differences of the statistical outputs,Coherence - cross domain,"Common product classifications (CPC) help to ensure cross-domain coherence. Production data in particularly are related to producer prices, land use, and trade data. Production and trade data have a high cross-domain coherence, as production and trade data are used as inputs in the food balance sheets, which serves as an additional validation of the data in a single supply and utilization framework."
17.1.1,Differences of the statistical outputs,Code - cross domain coherence,
17.2,Differences of the statistical outputs,Coherence - internal,It is expected that the internal coherence has been checked by countries before they send their data to FAO. FAO is not aware of any incoherence for the present dataset vis-??-vis other corresponding datasets.
18.0,Cost associated,Cost and Burden,
19.1,General revision policy,Data revision - policy,"Prefilled questionnaires are sent out with reported data for the previous two years (n-1, n-2), which countries are asked to revise when they report data for the new production year."
19.2,General revision policy,Data revision - practice,The revised data for n-1 and n-2 are disseminated concurrently with the initial year n data release.
20.1,Identification Data,Source data,"The main data source is official statistics from FAO member countries, collected either through annual production questionnaires (APQ) distributed to countries, from national publications (Yearbooks and Pocketbooks) or from official country websites. The source data can originate from surveys, administrative data and estimates based on expert observations. Which type of source is used by countries can significantly affect reliability and comparability of data. In nearly all cases where countries provide their official production data, data are recorded as reported by countries. The only exceptions are the application of conversion factors (e.g., if a country reports rice production on a husked rice basis, that production must be converted to a paddy basis), or cases of reporting errors (typically digit errors). In instances where no official data is available, data from semi-official sources (including commodity-specific trade publications) may be used. If no data from either official or unofficial sources is available, data are imputed. In all cases, data are flagged accordingly."
20.1.1,Identification Data,Code - Origin fro predominate  source data,
20.1.2,Identification Data,Code - type of data,
20.2,Identification Data,Frequency of data collection,Data are collected annually.
20.3,Identification Data,Code - Type and purpose of data collection,"Sample surveys are generally used but there are also cases where administrative records are used, see further country specific metadata."
20.4,Identification Data,Data validation,"Countries are responsible for transmitting data which have already been checked. Validation at FAO concerns any transmission errors and data consistency checks, as well as outlier detection. Other validations concerns assessing how far the current value is from the earlier data, consistency of totals and partial components and correspondence between variables from different data sets, e.g. between milk production and live animals producing milk."
20.5,Identification Data,Data compilation,"Data are uploaded for dissemination twice a year, irrespective of when they are delivered to FAO."
20.5.1,Identification Data,Code for type of processing,
20.5.2,Identification Data,Imputation rate (frequency and value),Years: 2006-2015  IR (%) IF (%)  Production (t) 15.5 52.9  Area harvested (ha) 21.1 48.9  IR: Imputation Rate is the proportion of value that is imputed considering non-official data only.IF: Imputation Frequency is the proportion of observations that have been imputed considering non-official data only.
20.5.3,Identification Data,Coverage rate,"FAO strives to provide data for all countries and commodities, where possible. However, many countries do not collect official production data for minor crops, such that data coverage for these commodities may be limited."
20.6,Identification Data,Adjustment,No adjustments are made.
21.0,Comment,Comment,"(1) Data of Iraq do not include Kurdistan region. (2) Since 2007 France data include French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Reunion territories but they exclude French Polynesia and New Caledonia territories. (3) The EU member country production data for the primary commodities for the years 2018 and 2019 are obtained from EUROSTAT (with some minor exceptions). If official EU data are missing in the production domain, then estimates are generated for the aggregates and within the framework of the Food Balances for the calculation of the food availability. (4) The 2014-2018 production data of the derived commodities are imputed in the framework of the Food Balance Sheet compilation in accordance with the FBS new methodology. Whereas before, the derived commodity production data were processed and generated externally in the production domain."
