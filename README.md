# Precision-farming-advisor
It is the Precision Farming advisory tool and has been developed with two main objectives. firstly, to provide crop recommendations based on dynamic environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, as well as soil attributes including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels; thereby aiding farmers in selecting the most suitable crops for prevailing conditions. Secondly, the tool offers fertilizer recommendations, considering soil characteristics such as N, P, and K levels, alongside seasonal variations, geographical area, and rainfall patterns. Leveraging advanced Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost, the system achieves an impressive accuracy rate of up to 96%.
